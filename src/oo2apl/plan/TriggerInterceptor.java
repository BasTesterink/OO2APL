/**
 * The following description holds for the 2APL default deliberation cycle. If you change the deliberation 
 * steps then this does not necessarily hold anymore.
 * 
 * A trigger interceptor can be interpreted as a temporary plan scheme. These interceptors are 
 * tried before the plan schemes are tried. If an interceptor is fired then it may or may not 
 * consume the trigger. Interceptors can be added to an agent from the planToAgentInterface, 
 * i.e. this is something that is part of plan. When an interceptor is fired, then it will be 
 * removed.
 * 
 * An example usage of an intercepter is to create a wait-for-message construct. For instance, 
 * if in a plan there is a moment where the plan has to wait for a message, then the plan may 
 * create a trigger interceptor with itself as the plan to be executed when the correct trigger 
 * is detected. 
 * 
 * Just like plan schemes, interceptors are categorized for goals, messages, external events and 
 * internal events.
